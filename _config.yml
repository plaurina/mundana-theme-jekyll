  A FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) blog where I share
  my thoughts, analytics, decisions, triumphs and failures. From someone who thought
  he could "retire first, then work the rest of his life" and then, at age 30, realized that was
  a dumb idea and still became Financially Independent before 40.
