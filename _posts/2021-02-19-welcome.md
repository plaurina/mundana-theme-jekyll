Welcome to my humble blog. I'm a software engineer, so analytical is my nature. Not only that, but my career  
has mainly been focused on the "Big Data" realm of technologies. Most of my career I didn't really need to know  
the data that I was dealing with it was my job to fill up hard drives and give rapid access back to others.  
Documentation is something software engineers are not well known for but I believe I have some great information  
to share with the world.

I intend to write this blog similar to how I speak and how I would give a presentation. I have always felt I was  
halfway decent at presentations, I'd have notes on what I would like to touch on, but I did not try to memorize  
the words I would say. I believe if you know what you are talking about and have done the advanced planning to  
know what your presentation is about, you should be able to clearly explain your concepts and information.  

Some posts might be long, I know I can be long-winded occasionally, so I will attempt brevity. One of my peeves   
with most youtube informational videos is their lack of brevity and that it takes 5 minutes to say 30 seconds of  
info. Call me out if I do that.

Again, welcome, I hope to hear from you.
