I started on my journey to FI before I met my wife, fortunately she had as well. I was focusing on primarily generating recurring income, mainly through the use of real estate but was also maxing out my retirement plans. My future wife was focusing on maxing out her retirement plans, paying down on her house, and taking some nice vacations.

#### TLDR;
  - Wife and I both had high savings rates before meeting each other
  - I focused on semi-passive recurring income streams (ie. Real Estate)
  - Wife focused on paying off her house and retirement plans
  - Single with $1M vs Married with $1M, are you really just half a milloinaire?

My wife and I met as adults, I was 37, so we both had established lives. While she grew up with a good financial game plan, for the most part she just did what her dad told her to do without asking too many questions. Her parents steered her right from an early age though. I took a more scenic route in life and got a bit of a late start on my savings and investing. 

She makes good money - and like most single people with high incomes - believed she would end up meeting someone who maked less. We didn't discuss incomes for a few months, but I could tell she thought she made more than me, so I kept my mouth shut. Ultimately, when we got married about a year and a half later, while going through all the financial pieces, our net-worths were about equal.  While she had a nicer house and a bit more retirement savings than me, I had multiple pieces of rental real estate and even my primary home was being paid for by multiple Airbnb rentals within it. So although we were networth equals, all my networth was working hard for me producing income.

Neither of us were millionaires however.  Individually, we were doing well, but we had not crossed that 7 digit net worth. But the day we married we understood what God says about marriage...

> ... "and the two shall become one flesh" 

So, on that day we together crossed the 7 digit mark into millionaire status. We did not feel any different, well besides being newly married of course. 

A million isn't what it once was. Being a millionaire in the 1930s or even in the 1970s was a bigger deal than it is in the 2020s. So should the requirement to be a milloinaire be $2M when you're married and $1M when you're single? I argue no because two hall become one, but I can definitely see the other side of the argument.
