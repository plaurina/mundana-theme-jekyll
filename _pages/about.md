I was stupid, I'm sure I still am sometimes too. When I graduated college I had somewhere around $100k in student loan
debt. I was constantly being told that I'm going to have them forever. I knew I wanted to be a software engineer since
I was in 4th grade, back then it was just called "computer programming". I called myself a "computer jock" because I
ran track, cross country, and was on the swim team through high school. I went to college, majored in Computer Science,
and played rugby for all 4 years. After graduating I was burned out from computers, so I worked construction and delivered
pizza for a year.

I move to Colorado, not for the tech scene that exists there now, but to be a ski bum! I figured, if I'm going to have
these student loans forever, I should

I did manage to find a "real job" in
the mountains, making $33k/year and living in Vail Colorado (Eagle-Vail/Avon technically). I was broke! I couldn't pay my
loans, so I kept deferring them. But I got 100 days of skiing/snowboarding in that year. I was promoted and move to Santa
Barbara, CA and given a raise... I was up to $35k now! Both in Vail and Santa Barbara, that income would be poverty levels.
I worked 3 jobs while in CA... computer programmer, pizza delivery, and a bike mechanic at the local bike shop. I surfed 4
days/week, and I rock climbed 3 days/week. Looking back, my Social Security info says I made a bit over $41k that year.

I got fired from the job in Santa Barbara after only 10 months and moved back to Colorado... yup, promoted and then fired.
I moved to Summit County this time and returned to being a ski bum, but this time I worked as a server at a fondu restaurant
and a banquet server at a ski resort. I got 120+ days in of skiing that year. But the student loans were over $120k now
and my deferments were up. I got a job down in the Denver area and moved down the mountain.

While I knew my first retirement was over, I still believed it would take until I was 65 to see that life again. I had a
better paying job now, Social Security shows I made almost $60k at this point.  I still was just floating by though, paying
on the debts, but not making any massive progress.

Fast forward 5 years and a friend introduced me to Dave Ramsey. I got in gear, sold a lot of the toys I had accumulated.
Over the course of 4 years I paid off the student loans. I was 34 years old. I realized... if I can pay off that much that
quick, I bet I can save/invest my way to freedom again!

I turn 40 in 2021, but in 6 years I went from being worthless ($0 net worth) to becoming Sub-40 FI! I broke into the 7
figure net worth club, I have a blend of stocks/mutual funds and real estate. Although I could retire and live on
$~$50k/year, I still love coding and continue to work. I discovered that the freedom FI grants has actually helped my
career.
